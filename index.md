# overthewire.org bandit challanges (27-34) solutions

Since more levels were added and nobody posted solutions for them, I decided to do it by myself.

## Bandit Level 26 â†’ Level 27

Here we basically continue with the same elusive shell. Once more, we should open our shell in the smallest size possible (allowing more to take action). The only tool we have is Vim and our hint is the "ls" command. Searching in /etc/passwd won't tell us anything, as well as trying to open /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27 or editing other files. Trying to execute "ls" command in Vim, or any other command won't work. Vim has an option to set a shell with :set command, so now we can set it to bash and work our way to the key.
in the main screen, press 'v' to enter Vim and then we execute:
`:set shell=/bin/bash`

now we have set up a bash shell. Let's run `:!ls -la`. Now we have found we have a file named "bandit27-do". This files gives us the ability to run files with bandit27 premissions. Let's run `:!./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27` and walla!:
